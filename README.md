### Setup

You'll need a terminal with Yarn installed to run this. VSCode is the recommended editor. 

To set this up, you'll need to, in the main directory, run:

```yarn install```

Then, once all the packages and dependencies are added, run

```yarn expo start```

To start the expo server.

You can connect with a tethered device, or via QR code with the Expo Go app for android.
